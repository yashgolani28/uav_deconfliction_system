# uav_deconfliction_system
A Python-based simulation tool to detect and visualize spatial and temporal conflicts between a primary drone mission and other scheduled UAV flights. Built for airspace safety and mission planning in multi-drone environments.

## Overview
This system checks whether a drone's planned waypoint mission is conflict-free by comparing it with other drones in shared airspace, considering both spatial and temporal overlaps.

## Features
- Spatial & temporal deconfliction
- Conflict explanation
- 3D visualization
- Modular Python codebase

## Setup
```bash
pip install matplotlib
